                <h2>Hi friends,</h2>
                <p>
                    My name is Michael Nguyen. I started my earliest career as a hairstylist, then attend Middle
                    Tennessee
                    State University (MTSU) for my undergraduate in Textiles, Merchandising and Design. After a
                    short-lived
                    career in the fashion industry, I went back to MTSU to study computer science.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You may be thinking, "Michael, that is quite a change", but in actuality they all have one important
                    thing in common. They all
                    rely on <strong>solving problems in a creative manner to help others achieve a specific
                        goal</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Creativity, problem-solving and helping others are three things that I am extremely passionate about
                    and
                    the
                    fact that I am constantly learning something new with web development brings me so much joy. I
                    believe
                    <strong>life-learning</strong> is an essential key to happiness. If there anything you would like to
                    know about me or just say hi, please reach out!
                </p>
